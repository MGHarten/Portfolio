                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        I'm Matt Harten. I started learning to code thanks to a
                        recommendation from a life-long friend and mentor in mid 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        I started with Mosh Hamedani's Python Mastery course alongside my
                        sister. As well as Harvard's free CS50 course online. Both instructors do a phenomenal job
                        and I
                        could not recommend either more highly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        I am extremely interested in machine learning algorithms & AI. One of my project goals is to
                        attempt to articulate a mechanical ankle joint for a prosthetic foot purely with a machine
                        learning algorithm to help improved mobility for amputees like myself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        I got this idea after helping with some research at North Carolina State University in
                        Raleigh,
                        North Carolina. The research was largely on controlling a prosthetic through neural input or
                        electrical signals detected as you attempted to use the muscles that no longer exist.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        My idea is to go the microprocessor knee route, but adding complexity, stability & hopefully
                        freedom of movement through passing the problem off to an algorithm. I am incredibly curious
                        and
                        hopeful that there is a solution here that has not been pursued yet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        I am now eagerly seeking opportunities to work on projects for my
                        portfolio & looking for employment as a software engineer.
